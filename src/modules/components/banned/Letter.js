      {/* <p>
        Since the inception of Powershotz.com we have struggled to find ways to
        allow our customers to use Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express,
        or any other credit card to purchase our legal products. When we found
        that no bank in the US would do business with us because our content
        violated Visa/MasterCard compliance guidelines we were forced to use
        third party credit card processors operating outside of the United
        States to process our transactions. When a product was purchased from us
        they collected 100% of the transaction amount. Several months after
        collecting our revenue, the credit card processor agrees to send us the
        money they collected from our customers, minus their transaction
        commission, usually around 15% of the sale amount. They are obligated by
        agreement to pass on 85% (100%-15%) to Powershotz.com. But not a single
        third party processor that we have worked with since the company started
        has honored their agreement. Because they operate outside of the United
        States, they are free to collect our revenue and steal it whenever they
        feel it is the right time to do so.
      </p> */}
      <p>
        We went through many cc processors over the years. Each one agreed to
        process transactions for us knowing full well what kind of pictures and
        video we sold. They built a large pool of money using the funds provided
        by our customers. This pool of money was intended to protect them should
        our business be shut down. As an adult producer, we were classified as
        “High Risk”, and as such were subject to excessive transaction
        processing fees and large hold backs. When the holdback account and the
        sum of transactions was large enough, they would abruptly terminate our
        agreement without notifying us as to why and keep the money they owed
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When our most recent third party credit card processor terminated our
        agreement, they also stole our entire website by claiming that they
        owned the content. We were forced to hire an attorney to get the website
        back at a cost of thousands of dollars. And we had only one option
        remaining to sell our legal products by credit card, Clips4sale.
        Clips4sale allowed us to open a store on their porn mega site many years
        ago. They collected a 40% fee, much higher than 15%.... but they were
        are only option to accept payment by credit card.
      </p>
      <p>
        In mid-December of 2020, clips4sale followed in the path of previous
        third-party processors and terminated their agreement with us, closed
        our store thus depriving us of our livelihood, did not notify us that
        they would not be paying us for our December sales. When we inquired, we
        were informed that we had violated our agreement with them, and that
        they had the right to keep the money that they owed us. They did so
        because they were informed by the compliance officers of Visa and
        Mastercard that if they continued to work with us they would no longer
        be allowed to accept credit card transactions. It would put them out of
        business. So they closed our store to remain in business. During the
        years that they processed for us we sent them millions of customers and
        they profited from our traffic as well as 40% of our sales volume. Once
        again we lost all recurring monthly memberships and thousands of
        customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we are starting over again. Selling content with no blood, no
        injuries of any kind, no assault with deadly weapons or threats of life
        and limb or extreme torture or anything related to under age. We were
        extremely careful over the years to dot all i’s and cross all t’s when
        it came to proving that our models were of legal age and that all or our
        taxes were paid in full because we knew that an adult producer operating
        in a conservative region of the country would be under close scrutiny at
        all times. Each model that posed for our website was assumed to be an
        officer of the law and we were investigated many times during our years
        in operation. The police knew we were here. We offered to help them on
        several occasions.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now we have an option to sell our products online and get paid for
        our high risk, hard work……Bitcoin. Bitcoin, can be used ….for all
        debts….public and private. I heard that was written on some piece of
        paper once by some old farts that tried to form a government based on
        rule of law and equity for all regardless of race, color, religion, sex,
        sexual orientation or what they liked to watch in their own free time.
        Going through the hassle of learning how to use bitcoins and being
        worried that something is going to happen and you are going to lose your
        money if you click on the wrong button placing an order using a bitcoin
        was not how we planned to provide customer service. But we are not
        living in a free country and the dollar is not legal tender for all
        debts public and private when it is controlled by a compliance officer
        operating out of a closet in Eastern Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warning!!! Powershotz is out of compliance with Visa/MasterCard
        compliance guidelines!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not use your dollar here!!! It no longer exists!!! And our
        company is officially censored for the good of the nation!! And you have
        no right to use your hard earned money to buy something from a banned
        non-compliant like Powershotz.com! Now run along and do as you are told
        by your betters!
      </p>
      <p>
        We started working 24/7 on this problem when clips4sale let us know that
        our store was closed two weeks before Christmas. We can’t advertise with
        Google or any other advertising company in the world. Even in their
        restricted adult space. Google like all other institutions controlled by
        federal regulators has opted to exclude themselves from our deadly
        products because they too are terrified of this brave new world where
        businesses are accused of a crime, tried in the kangaroo court of the
        compliance officer’s head, found guilty of the crime they were accused
        of but never heard that they were being accused of, and finally passed
        judgement upon by the holy compliance guidelines makers that attempt to
        control our thoughts to enforce their own moral authority in the
        formerly free United Socialist States of America.
      </p>
      <p>
        Party on Comrades!!! Living under socialism in a party ruled police
        state isn’t that bad. They write you checks whenever you need money. And
        besides, you don’t need to be looking at pornographic images of people
        being tied up and beaten until they beg for sex to be set free. You can
        get all the rape, murder, child torture, bloody mass murder and
        executions you want on Netflix or Amazon or Hulu or Voodoo! Watch it
        with the kids after church. As long as no sex is involved (well most of
        the time….sort of like Clinton described it) you can watch entire
        schools blown to bits with body parts blown all over the place and
        everyone dripping in blood! Kids thrown off buildings while their mother
        is raped nearby. All sorts of cool scenes like that. And the smart law
        maker who is oh so brave standing over the field of bodies piled high
        with a few still moving but not for long is the hero of the story.
        Aspire to be like him. The compliance officers have given their
        permission.
      </p>
      <p>Powershotz.com is in a fight! And we are going to win! </p>
      <p>
        We have had to rebuild the website once again and implement payment by
        bitcoin to allow us to sell our legal products online using your cheap
        plastic that is backed by the full faith and credit of a country running
        up 30 trillion in debt…. through a tedious multi step process. Once we
        get it set up bitcoins are easy but it isn’t straight forward at first
        and it takes a while to learn. We still take payment through the mail
        for those who believe that neither foul weather nor dark of night staves
        the courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds….unless
        they confiscate it first and sell it. I hear our content is highly
        valued on the black market and watched frequently by customs and postal
        inspectors before being sold for fun and profit around the world to
        people of all ages, races, religions and sexual orientations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warning: Don’t try to sneak around any payment systems using PayPal.
        PayPal bans for life! Obviously, PayPal wants nothing to do with our
        content. They prefer to watch it in the closet when nobody is looking.
        They could tell you they watch it in secret….but then they’d have to
        ……..ahhhh…..Bill You! Later….
      </p>
      <p>
        Rest assured that your credit card compliance officers are doing their
        best to protect us from making the mistake of buying something that we
        shouldn’t be buying according to them. And they will work tirelessly
        scouring the net for free porn they don’t believe you should be
        watching. It’s ok for children to watch porn though. They just need to
        be taught to click on the line where it says I am over 21. It takes a
        while, but kids learn pretty quick. You who are the credit card company
        Mastercard could easily create a new compliance guideline that would
        prevent companies that give free porn to minors from profiting by the
        use of your credit card payment system. But apparently you prefer to
        write compliance guidelines that only shut down one or a few small
        companies that don’t affect anyone’s bottom line when their business
        volume disappears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides…..why take free porn away from minors when it means that anyone
        who had to pass a high security background clearance test won’t be able
        to watch porn if it isn’t free. If they have a purchase to a bondage
        porn site on their credit card statement…. watch out career in law
        enforcement. So the law makers who can only watch porn if it is
        free….are fine allowing our children to watch it for free along with
        them. How nice. Living under socialism has a lot of benefits if you
        learn to follow the rules and keep your mouth shut about losing stupid
        liberties.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for those bad actors like Powershotz.com who shoot scenes of women
        being grabbed and struggle stripped and tied up naked in all sorts of
        positions and then forced to beg for sex in order to be set free
        unharmed….those are the bad websites that need to be shut down!
        Especially if the man is wearing a mask and the girl acts like she
        thinks she is going to be raped!!! It promotes violence!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry folks…. the opposite is true. When porn is introduced to a
        community that didn’t have it….the crime rate drops. When bondage porn
        is not allowed in a community…..the crime rate in the community is high.
        The more violent the porn, the lower the violent crime rate……go figure.
        I guess there might be something to the argument that a potential rapist
        who whacks off to a rape video is less likely to commit that rape when
        his stress is relieved by whacking off. Too bad the data can’t be spoken
        of in public. Wouldn’t be proper to talk about how masturbation reduces
        stress and therefore violent crime rates here in the land of the free
        lunch….home of the dead brave.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have but two words to say to all competing credit card companies who
        work together using the same compliance guidelines to prevent one
        business from operating and allow other businesses to continue to use
        their credit card services that are giving away porn to kids! Just so
        politicians can watch it for free…… <b>Fuck You!!!!!</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d like to say see you in court but we all know that’ll never happen.
        You have the best liars…sorry lawyers….money can buy! Can’t go up
        against them and demand a multibillion-dollar settlement without an
        attorney. Not unless you really are a complete idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
        How about we try this instead of wasting all that time paying liars to
        pay judges to lie to insurers…
      </p>
      <p>MasterCard,</p>
      <p>
        I charge you with collusion for working together with competing credit
        card companies to create compliance guidelines that prevent
        Powershotz.com from using its own countries currency in the form of a
        credit card payment online.
      </p>
      <p>
        I charge you with child endangerment for working with companies that
        allow adult content to be seen by children worldwide without age
        verification or parental consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        I charge you with child endangerment for working with companies that
        allow adult content to be seen by children worldwide without age
        verification or parental consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        I charge you with censorship that you display publicly in bold face
        against Powershotz.com
      </p>
      <p>
        You allow free porn websites that have copies of all of our videos and
        still images on their servers being given away to the tune of billion a
        month to continue to use your credit card services selling premium
        memberships that allow those who pay to watch the same content that is
        given away….but in a higher resolution format. And then turn around and
        ban Powershotz.com for the same content.
      </p>
      <p>Your behavior is illegal, unconstitutional, and flat out shameful.</p>
      <p>My demands are simple: </p>
      <p>
        You will create a new compliance guideline. It will state simply that if
        your company is giving away adult content to minors you may not accept
        credit card as payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gets free porn off the internet. I’m sorry folks. But when we were
        kids, playboys were behind the black plastic and you had to be an adult
        to look.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes a huge amount of money for the credit card companies. When
        porn can only be purchased by credit card there will be a huge amount of
        business created for Visa and MasterCard. And payment by credit card
        insures the website owner that the person making the purchase is an
        adult.
      </p>
      <p>
        All other compliance guidelines related to adult material are to be
        eliminated. People can watch any show they want to buy. It’s a show. Not
        real life. It’s art. Whether you like it or not it is art. If a crime is
        being committed the victim of that crime has a right to accuse us of
        committing a crime. And we have a right to know our accuser. Not some
        nameless compliance officer following a vague set of guidelines put
        forth by a few LA attorneys to protect the banks from being accused of
        being partners in the crimes of their clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        You get off easy. A class action suit by all porn producers would be
        much more expensive. There are over 200 Powershotz models that would
        need to be compensated for the fact that they were made international
        superstars recognizable by any 12-year-old boy in the world and were
        only paid a few hundred bucks for it. And the fact that I find my scenes
        being given away in multibillion dollar a month quantity to kids and top
        cops around the globe because you believe censorship is more important
        than following the fucking law! No free porn to minors! I did not get
        into this business to have my content stolen and given away to kids in
        multibillion dollar quantities!!!
      </p>
      <p>Thank you,</p>
