      <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
      <h3>Site Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        Powershotz has been online since May of 2000. The website features
        gorgeous female models in tight restrictive bondage, damsel-in-distress
        fantasy, rape fantasy, and master/slave fantasy. All scenes on this site
        are consensual and rehearsed. It's all acting. No underage fantasy, no
        physical injuries, marks, bruising, or blood. Display of body and
        emotion in a consensual role-playing environment is a protected
        constitutional right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every relationship contains aspects of domination and submission. Taking
        dominant and submissive roles into the fantasy realm is therefore a
        natural and healthy response. These scenes assist the visualization of
        the fantasy and provide a tension release. In the past we depended on
        armies of strong men to defend our countries against constant attack.
        Many jobs were tough and labor-intensive, requiring men to do the work
        while the women stayed home to tend the children. Today, however,
        advances in technology have set females free to compete on an equal
        footing with men in many previously all-male occupations. This leads to
        sexual frustration in both sexes as we struggle with the species change
        implications. Instinctively, we want to return to the way things were,
        our genetics haven't had a chance to catch up with our culture. So when
        we get the chance to role-play... we go back in time to remember.
      </p>

        Horror movies have tied up, chopped up, raped, murdered and mutilated
        people with vivid realism in every way imaginable. Those movies are
        available to everyone at any time of the day just by renting a DVD. The
        work on this site takes it in a different direction... with the victim
        still alive at the end... and walking away wishing they didn't have to
        leave. In effect, they are set free by their forced captivity. We also
        require proof of age and are not advertised in non-adult venues as are
        more violent productions that are available anywhere DVDs are rented or
        sold.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also a great way to show off that gorgeous body in the most twisted
        and bizarre forms imaginable! Something artists have always been
        after...

        All of the scenes on this site were rehearsed and carefully acted out
        with utmost regard for personal safety and consent. Nothing on this site
        is forced. There is no underage fantasy or the appearance of underage
        fantasy. The dominant figure acts to position and control the submissive
        figure's body while eliciting vocal responses. Actresses are not marked,
        bruised, pierced, or tortured and have the ability to stop the scene at
        any time. Some scenes contain full nudity while others are fully
        clothed. The models are adventurous and energetic, and pour a
        significant part of themselves into these roles. They deserve the credit
        for the work.

        You are running the risk of injuring your partner and/or getting thrown
        in jail. While it may not be outwardly apparent, a great deal of
        planning, rehearsing, flexibility testing, and thought, went into the
        avoidance of personal injury. This is, in effect, kinky stunt work.
